# Spectrum Visualizer

A simple ncurses based audio spectrum visualizer to help teach me about reading file headers, basic signal processing and building with ncurses. It takes audio files as input (supports .mp3, .flac and .wav) and visualizses them in realtime. Would idealy like to eventually attach onto ALSA output and visualize all and every audio output on a system.
